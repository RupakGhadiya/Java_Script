// Variables are basically containers to store data values 

var num1 = 5
var num2 = 4
console.log(num1 + num2)

// hear we have declare or we can say store a value 5 in variable called num1 which can be re use ferther

let num3 = 5
// let is a variabe that can reasign later it is block-scoped, 
// which means that they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared.

const PI = 3.14
// it is a variable which is also block-scoped but cannot reasign it is fixed value
